This is an Automation engineering challenge.

I used the playwright test tool.


You can:
 - **Watch the test plan + short explaination in TEST_PLAN.docx.**
 - **Watch the tests code in the TESTS directory in the CHECKOUT_TESTS.SPEC.TS**
   (There are 2 tests: 'Check if subtotal + tax = total' and 'Check if product features match the summary')
 - **Watch a more generic atittude in LOOP_MULTIPLE_SCENARIOS.SPEC.TS**
  (Loops over every product and plan and tests 'Check if subtotal + tax = total')
  - Download the CHECKOUT_TESTS.SPEC.TS screen video while tests are running, in WATCH_TEST_SCREEN.zip
 - See Commented previous attempts in the WATCH_MY_ATTEMPTS directory. Numbered versions.
   (The code in previous versions is sequential and without the need to navigate to the checkout page before each test, compared to the final code which is more modular.)
